# YinYangFit â˜¯
*A letterfitting model inspired by biology*

## Overview
There are three parts to this project:

1. **An explanation of the model,** updated regularly as I refine it. (You're
   reading this at the moment.)
2. **A Jupyter notebook** hosted on Google Colab, which I use to experiment with
   different variations on the model. I will make the notebook public soon. Note that I'm using it as a live-coding
   environment, so don't expect clean code.
3. **A letterfitting tool** designed for end users. This will probably take the
   form of a Python script, perhaps with a simple browser interface, which takes
   in any font file and adds spacing and kerning values according to the model.
   This doesn't exist yet.

## Acknowledgements
A big thank-you to Google for their generous funding of this research project.

## Project plan
* September 2019: publish basic concept
* October 2019: publish Colab notebook
* Sometime, hopefully in 2019: converge on a model that works universally
* Late 2019 / early 2020: build and publish letterfitting tool
