<h2 class="nonumber">Abstract</h2>
Adjusting letter distances to be visually pleasing is a challenging and
time-consuming task. As existing tools are too primitive to reliably handle the
infinite variety of typefaces, designers still need to rely on their intuitive
judgment.
I review how letterfitting fits into the current scientific understanding of how
letters and words are perceived in the brain, and present approximate models
that can be fitted to to existing, hand-fitted fonts using backpropagation.

<h2 class="nonumber">Target audience</h2> 
Designers and developers with an interest in neuroaesthetics.

This article is based on a survey of hundreds of peer-reviewed articles, 
and in line with mainstream ideas in vision and neuroscience research. It is the
product of many months of work and countless revisions. That said, even the
in-vivo evidence for the suggested models is often indirect or circumstantial.
Nothing in this article should be construed as final. I welcome corrections!
