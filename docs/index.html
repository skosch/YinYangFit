Abstract
</h2>
<p>Adjusting letter distances to be visually pleasing is a challenging and time-consuming task. As existing tools are too primitive to reliably handle the infinite variety of typefaces, designers still need to rely on their intuitive judgment. I review how letterfitting fits into the current scientific understanding of how letters and words are perceived in the brain, and present approximate models that can be fitted to to existing, hand-fitted fonts using backpropagation.</p>

<p>This article is based on a survey of hundreds of peer-reviewed articles, and in line with mainstream ideas in vision and neuroscience research. It is the product of many months of work and countless revisions. That said, even the in-vivo evidence for the suggested models is often indirect or circumstantial. Nothing in this article should be construed as final. I welcome corrections!</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>Letterfitting refers to the process of adjusting the distances between pairs of <nobr>letters<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-1" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">I use the word “letter” very liberally; the more general term is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glyph">glyph</a>.</span> during typeface design. <nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-2" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-2" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote"><img src="img/spacingkerning.png" alt="Spacing and kerning"><br> Red vertical bars show side bearings, blue vertical bar shows a negative kern.</span> It’s often referred to as “spacing and kerning”, because pair distances are the sum of fixed amounts of space around every letter (so-called <em>side bearings</em>) and additional adjustment values for individual pairs (so-called <em>kerns</em>). Quality fonts often contain thousands of hand-kerned pairs that undergo weeks of testing and refinement, all by hand—because surprisingly, there still are no automated solutions that reliably do the <nobr>job.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-3" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">And not for lack of trying: many approaches exist, the most popular of which are listed in the <a href="#existing_tools">appendix</a> below.</span></p>
<p>The heart of the problem: typographers can’t even agree what letterfitting <em>does</em>. Some say that it’s about achieving a certain <em>balance</em> between letter pairs, the judgment of which is to spring from the designer’s personal aesthetic <nobr>intuition.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-4" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">It goes without saying that as for the design decisions of professional typographers, <em>non disputandum est</em>. This is the premise behind the venerable <a href="https://type.method.ac/">kern game</a>.</span> Others say that the goal is to produce an “even colour”, i.e. a printed page with a uniform texture and without noticeable blobs of black or white. Yet others have <nobr>insinuated<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-5" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">First and foremost Frank Blokland, who in his <a href="https://www.lettermodel.org/">PhD thesis</a> investigated how practical considerations in the Renaissance printing trade may have led to a standardization of font metrics.</span> that the distances between letter stems are really quite arbitrary, and that we are simply conditioned by existing fonts to (prefer to) read letters at particular pair distances.</p>
<p>All three of the above descriptions seem to point to the same story: that skilled designers achieve a pleasing visual balance between letter pairs because they have honed their perception through the careful study of existing fonts, and that perfectly balanced letter pairs also happen to result in perfect legibility and a perfectly even typographic colour. Does that story hold water?</p>
<p>As it turns out, research suggests that colour, balance, and legibility have <em>different</em> neural correlates. They are often in rough agreement, but optimizing for one does not guarantee a good outcome for the others. Evenness of colour is a question of texture perception; quality of balance is a question of competitive inhibition between perceptual gestalt groups; and legibility is a question of the reliable detection of letters and n-grams from pre-processed visual features. On top of that, all of the above are affected differently by font size and colour contrast.</p>
<p>If we want to develop robust, universal automatic letterfitting <nobr>algorithms—</nobr>algorithms that work on both hairline slab serifs and broad-nib italics, on both captions and headline sizes, on both Latin and Hangul—then we need to build better intuitions for the neural dynamics of our vision system. That’s what this article is about.</p>
<p>In a way, it is surprising that type design and cognitive psychology are so divorced from one <nobr>another.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-6" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The studies that do exist are almost exclusively empirical (see e.g. the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004269891930%201087">review of legibility studies</a> compiled recently by type legend Charles Bigelow) but have no explanatory power. In fact, the typesetting of most preprints suggests that cognitive scientists are altogether unaware of typography as a discipline.</span> Computational models of vision and reading need to be tested against ground-truth data, of which existing fonts are a rich, reliable, and free source. Conversely, type designers could massively benefit from tools that emulate aspects of human vision. I hope to see much more cross-fertilization between the two fields in the future.</p>
<h2 id="a-letterfitters-objectives">A letterfitter’s objectives</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the science, let’s review how the three ideas fit into a broader cognitive science context.</p>
<p>Typographic colour refers to the visual texture created by the ink on the page. Most obviously, a darker colour is the result of bolder, narrower, more tightly-fit type. But the line spacing contributes to a document’s characteristic texture as well, and so does the angle of the letters (i.e. upright vs. italic) and, ultimately, the design of the individual letters. Some design teachers like to give colour-based letterfitting prescriptions, like “match the black and the white” or “equalize the negative space in the counters with the negative space in the gaps.”<nobr><input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-7" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Like horoscopes, these rules only work when they are formulated vaguely enough to be useless.</span> As we will see later, these heuristics are actually a primitive version of the kind of spatial frequency correlations that form the basis of texture perception.</p>
<p>Next, balance. The brain has a general tendency to group visual features into perceptually coherent objects. Meanwhile, the typographer’s job is to group letters into perceptually coherent words. When the letters are fitted poorly, the perceptual grouping into words will fail: this we call poor balance.</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-8" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-8" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">Here, the saturation of the coloured blobs indicates the intensity of grouping at different scales. Small perceptual groups tend to outcompete larger ones, so unless the grouping is balanced, the word will be fragmented. The poorly fitted word in the last column triggers the perception of two separate objects, namely the single letter c and a pair at.</span> <img src="img/grouping_relativity.png" alt="Illustration of the importance of consistency of fit vs absolute distances."></p>
<p>Perceptual grouping networks are a very fundamental piece of our vision circuitry, and not exclusive to reading. Researchers have known about them for a long time, too: psychologists over a century ago described our tendency to recognize the sum, not the parts, of arrangements of <nobr>shapes:<input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-9" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-9" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">These are often listed as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping">Gestalt laws of grouping</a>, or the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Pr%C3%A4gnanz">Prägnanz</a>. Because these early Gestalt psychologists knew little about the brain’s vision system, they hypothesized about their findings using sometimes abstruse metaphors drawn from electromagnetics, fluid mechanics, and even personality studies—in fact, their vocabulary of lights, shadows, and force fields closely matched that often employed to justify today’s letterfitting heuristics. I recommend Johan Wagemans et al.’s fantastic two-part historical review of Gestalt psychology, published in 2012 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3482144/">part I</a>, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1037%2Fa0029334">part II</a>).</span> <img
src="img/gestalt_laws.png" alt="Illustration of gestalt laws" /></p>
<p>Finally, legibility. Children first learn to recognize individual letters as physical objects, then learn to associate these objects with sounds, then learn to reproduce the sounds letter by letter, and finally become skilled readers by developing neurons that detect, as a shortcut, combinations of letters directly. Each one of these developmental steps builds on the next by repurposing a different area of the brain. A type designer manipulating a letter shape will perceive it as a geometric object (like a child), but an adult reading the newspaper perceives combinations of letters in parallel (or almost in parallel) using entirely unrelated neural circuitry. These letter-combination-detecting neurons work best, of course, on letter pairs that resemble those seen in the past. It would be unwise to ignore this conditioning effect, but fortunately we can fit primarily for Gestalt and still achieve great legibility simply because other fonts were designed by humans, and therefore fit, by and large, for Gestalt as well.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-tour-through-our-visual-system-area-v1">A brief tour through our visual system: area V1</h2>
<p>Our brain’s visual processing system is divided into multiple regions, each of which represents the incoming visual imagery at a different level of abstraction. Anything we see—landscapes, patterns, text—activates neurons in each one of these brain areas. While neurons in the lower-level areas respond to concrete details in the visual input, neurons in higher-level areas respond to the presence of particular configurations of such details. Both low- and higher-level areas are involved in perception, allowing us to simultaneously experience the raw visual qualia <em>and</em> comprehend what we see on a more abstract level.</p>
<p>Whether we are looking at an apple (and recognizing it as such), a tree (and recognizing it as such), or a word (and reading it)–most of of the neurons involved are the same.</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-10" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-10" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote"> All visual input activates several pieces of visual cortex before reaching dedicated object-detection circuitry such as the Visual Word Form Area (VWFA). We will discuss mainly V1, V2, and V4 (the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-streams_hypothesis">ventral stream</a>); many other regions exist that are dedicated to visual tasks less relevant to reading, such as keeping track of moving objects. This big-picture view of reading was perhaps most clearly articulated in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00134-7">this 2003 article</a> by the prolific reading researchers McCandliss, Cohen and Dehaene. As we will discuss later, the VWFA is actually multiple areas.</span> <img src="img/vision_model.png" alt="Vision model"></p>
<p>Many readers may have had some exposure, however superficial, to the concept of deep convolutional networks. It is tempting to conceptualize the architecture of the visual cortex as such a network: yes, raw visual input enters at the bottom, undergoes convolution through multiple layers, then comes out the top as a neat classification of a word. But perception, and perceptual grouping in particular, is a dynamic process. It is not a computation with input and output, but a dance of electrical activity that evolves through <nobr>time.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-11" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"><a href="http://nxxcxx.github.io/Neural-Network/">This interactive visualization</a> is far from realistic but a much more useful visual metaphor than feed-forward deep learning diagrams.</span> At high resolution, it unfortunately takes unworkably large computational resources to simulate these dynamics accurately, so feed-forward convolutional nets may well end up playing a role in the design of letterfitting models, but for now, the goal is to gain an appreciation for our neural feedback loops.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s go on a brief tour through our visual system.</p>
<p>Sensory input from the eye travels up the optic nerve, through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) on the brain’s thalamus, to the visual cortex at the very back of the <nobr>head.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-12" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">For our computational purposes, we will ignore any image processing performed by the retina and thalamus, such as the luminance adaptation and pooling operations performed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinal_ganglion_cell">retinal ganglion cells</a>.</span></p>

<p>The first phalanx of cells—the primary visual cortex, or V1—performs what amounts to a band-filtered wavelet decomposition. Each neuron here is <nobr>retinotopically<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-14" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">That is, neurons are laid out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinotopy">roughly mirror the organization of the retina</a>, such that adjacent photoreceptors are connected to nearby neurons in the cortex.</span> connected directly to a small contiguous group of photoreceptors, its <em>receptive field</em> <nobr>(RF),<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-15" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">To be clear, the majority of neurons physically located in V1 don’t actually receive direct input from the eye but rather just serve as local connections to facilitate basic image enhancement, such as contrast normalization, but we will skip here the organization of V1’s layers.</span> and activates whenever a particular subset of the receptors detects light but the others don’t. The on/off subsets are laid out such that each neuron effectively detects a small piece of a line or edge of a particular size and orientation somewhere in the field of <nobr>vision.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-16" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">This is a relatively well-known concept, because the same kinds of receptive fields tend to emerge in the first layer of image-classifying convolutional networks. For those readers completely unfamiliar with these ideas, I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnVLXr0qFT8">this introductory animation</a>, followed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtPgW1ebxmE">this Allen Institute talk</a> about the visual system, followed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9HYPlE8xzc">this in-depth MIT lecture</a> on the anatomical details.</span></p>
<p><img src="img/edge_line_rfs.png" /></p>
<p>These neurons are called <em>simple cells</em>, and we can easily predict their response to a given input, depending on the tuning and location of their receptive <nobr>fields.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-17" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel first discovered this in the 1950s by showing patterns of light to a cat after sticking electrodes into its brain (Youtube has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yoo4GWiAx94">video of said cat</a>). The researchers went on to win a Nobel Prize for their experiments.</span> In software models, the filtering operation performed by simple cells is typically implemented as Fourier-domain multiplication with a bank of complex band-pass filters, each of which is tuned to a particular orientation and spatial frequency. Given a dark vertical bar as visual input, sets of similarly-tuned V1 simple cells might respond as such:</p>
<p><img src="img/single_i_example.png" /></p>
<p>As it turns out, some V1 neurons are less sensitive to phase than others, and some may even respond equally to both lines and edges, as long as scale and orientation match their tuning. Those cells are called <em>complex cells</em><nobr>.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-18" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Simple and complex cells lie along a spectrum of phase specificity, which is brilliantly explained by <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/09/25/782151.f%20ull.pdf">this recent paper</a> by Korean researchers Gwangsu Kim, Jaeson Jang and Se-Bum Paik. But it seems that there’s even more to the story, as complex cells seem to <a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00660536/document">change their simpleness index</a> in response to their input as well.</span> Thanks to their phase invariance, complex cells can extract key structural information at the expense of colour and contrast data. They respond wherever the frequency scale and orientation matches their tuning. In the following picture, all complex cell responses of a given frequency scale are shown together, regardless of the orientation:</p>
<p><img src="img/single_i_complex_example.png" /></p>
<p>Coincidentally, contrast and colour are irrelevant to reading—we can read black-on-white just as well as white-on-black—suggesting that it is mainly complex cells that provide the relevant signals to higher-level brain <nobr>areas.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-19" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-19" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">In practice, it is measurably easier to read dark text on light backgrounds. Not only do light backgrounds make the pupil contract, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apergo.2016.11.001">creating a sharper image</a>, but V1 outputs are also <a href="https:///doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1991-09.2009">stronger for darker colours</a>, which may contribute to shape perception in higher-level stages. Nevertheless, reading is primarily shape- and not colour-based.</span></p>
<p>To be clear, this does not mean that the signals from simple cells are lost or discarded. Just like the signals from colour-detecting cells in the so-called <em>blob</em> regions of V1, which are not further discussed here, the signals from simple cells do contribute both to our experience of vision and to the activity of higher-level brain regions. For reading (and thus letterfitting) purposes, however, we will focus on the responses of complex cells.</p>
<p>Neurons in V1 (and elsewhere in the cortex) use lateral connections to inhibit their neighbours. This is called <em>lateral inhibition</em>. Because the strength of the inhibition depends directly on the strength of the neuron’s own activation, this setup helps the most active neuron to mute its neighbours. This sharpens the response landscape, which is necessary in practice considering that neurons tuned <em>almost</em> to the right orientation and frequency (but not quite) will still fire quite a bit, effectively adding noise to the signal. Lateral inhibition means that V1 neuron’s firing rates take some time to stabilize, something that models may need to take into account.</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-20" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-20" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote"><img src="img/csf.png" alt="Contrast sensitivity function">Contrast sensitivity function. The vertical gradient in contrast is uniform across the image, but we most easily perceive the mid-frequency gratings even at lower contrasts. Note that the red line, shown here only for illustrative purposes, may not match the contrast sensitivity function you experience at your current viewing distance and screen settings.</span> Another aspect of vision that appears to manifest quite early during visual processing—setting aside the optical limitations of our eye—is our specific sensitivity to spatial frequencies. Humans respond particularly well to angular frequencies of about 2–5 cycles per degree, and unsurprisingly this translates to reading speed as well, <em>especially</em> under low-contrast <nobr>conditions.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-21" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-21" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">See studies like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/9.9.16">Chung and Tjan (2009)</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/6.6.118">Oruç and Landy (2006)</a>, and many others.</span> This, of course, is a key reason why e.g. hairline type is difficult to read at smaller-than-huge sizes and a comparatively wide fit. The reader’s contrast sensitivity function may in fact contribute to the exact relative weighting of the laterally-inhibitive connections; in other words, mid-scale signals may outcompete fine-scale signals by default. Even lacking perfect information about such correlations, we can point to the contrast sensitivity function as the most basic biological <em>raison d’être</em> for optical sizes in typography, and to models based on spatial frequency channels as a natural fit for this aspect of letterfitting.</p>
<p>We will return to the question of how V1 outputs vary in response to changing pair distances in a later section. For now, let’s move on to how these signals are processed in subsequent areas.</p>
<h2 id="area-v2-portilla-simoncelli-texture-correlations-and-crowding-effects">Area V2, Portilla-Simoncelli texture correlations, and crowding effects</h2>
<p>Area V1 deconstructs the incoming imagery into thousands of edge and line fragments. Area V2 helps find patterns in those signals, patterns that form the basis for the perceptual grouping effect we are interested in.</p>
<p>Each neuron in V2 takes its input from a combinations of neurons in <nobr>V1,<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-22" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Again, we will skip here a discussion of the various layers and interneurons of V2.</span> creating receptive fields that can be twice as large as those in V1. For each V2 neuron, the choices of V1 inputs are endless (within the constraints of approximate retinotopicity), and indeed, V2 contains a vast variety of cells representing all kinds of different correlations between V1 signals: correlations between V1 simple cells and complex cells, between V1 cells of different scales and orientations, and between V1 cells at different spatial locations. <nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-23" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-23" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote"><img src="img/v1_v2.png" alt="Connections from V1 to V2">V2 cells take their input from a nearby V1 cells, correlating receptive fields across dimensions of space, simpleness/complexity, orientation, and spatial frequency scale.</span></p>
<p>Presumably, the ability to respond to correlations—not just sums—of inputs from V1 is conferred to V2 neurons by their nonlinear activation curve. Consider a toy example in which two V1 neurons each fire with rates between 0 and 1.0. Then a V2 neuron with the following activation curve would fire only if <em>both</em> inputs are sufficiently active, summing to at least 1.5, thereby implementing correlation:</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-24" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-24" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">Shown on the left is another hyperbolic ratio function. But even simple squaring nonlinearities would allow computing correlations; Anthony Movshon and Eero Simoncelli <a href="10.1101/sqb.2014.79.024844">call this</a> the “cross term”, referring to the <span class="math inline">ab</span> in <span class="math inline">(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2</span>. Finally, the dashed line shows the deep-learning equivalent nonlinearity <span class="math inline">\mathrm{ReLU(x-1.0)}</span>.</span> <img
src="img/v2_nonlinearity.png" alt="Nonlinear activation of V2 neurons
enables computation of correlations"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have no direct measurements of what each of these neurons respond to most strongly. However, pre-trained image classification networks contain units in their early convolutional layers that are, presumably, somewhat analog to V2 cells. By iteratively adjusting white noise until these units are maximally activated, we can estimate what kinds of correlations in the input they are tuned to:</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-25" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-25" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">These images were adapted from an <a href="https://doi.org/10.23915/distill.00024">interactive online article</a> by Chris Olah and his colleagues at OpenAI, who have published lots of neat approaches to explain and interpret the inner workings of convolutional networks.

<p>On their own, many of these correlations may appear to be meaningless. Together, however, they describe the local texture of an image. As it turns out, a mere few dozen of such correlations are enough to fool human texture perception: we can iteratively generate fake images, starting again from white noise, that result in the same combination of local averages of these presumed V2 responses as in the original <nobr>image.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-26" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-26" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The first iteration of this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026553619983">idea</a> came about in 1999, long before the heyday of convolutional deep nets, and is due to to Javier Portilla and Eero Simoncelli. Two decades later, these “Portilla-Simoncelli textures” have inspired countless psychological studies and attempts to refine the model.</span> If the local averaging takes place over a large area, as is the case in the visual periphery, this can result in very distorted imagery that nonetheless appears uncannily real:</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-27" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-27" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">The “image metamer” shown here was <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnn.2889">generated</a> by Jeremy Freeman and Eero Simoncelli in 2011 based on the same principle of matching image statistics. As in the human brain, the authors averaged the statistics over a wider area in the periphery than in the fovea. When focusing strictly on the image center (best viewed closely or after zooming in), the metamer is difficult to distinguish from the original.</span> <img src="img/metamers.png" alt="From 'Metamers of the ventral

<p>As evident here, a mere approximation of these averaged image statistics measured by V2 is enough to simulate, with eerie fidelity, how we perceive our visual periphery. This is no coincidence: after all, higher-level areas (here, V4) precisely respond to particular configurations of such V2 neurons, so synthesizing images which evoke similar V2 activations will also result in similar higher-level perceptions, even if the actual input signals are quite <nobr>different.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-28" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-28" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">One could think of this as the bizarro-version of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning">adversarial input</a>.</span></p>
<p>That V2 neurons so effectively capture local image statistics presents us with a first opportunity to reify the heretofore vague concept of typographic “colour” into something concrete and computable: namely, local combinations of such (simulated) V2 responses. If these remain uniform across the whole page, the texture is perceived as even:</p>

The comparably poor quality of this example taken from their paper should not be taken as reason to dismiss the idea; it was generated at low resolution over two decades ago and averaged the statistics too aggressively. Many more sophisticated variants of the model have since been published, with promising results especially on natural scenes.</span> <img

<p>In a truly colour-based letterfitting strategy, which should be relatively easy to implement, we would iteratively adjust pair distances within an image of text until a chosen set of V2 responses is nice and uniform across the entire image. And indeed, this would probably be the most effective and biologically faithful approach to achieve a perfectly even texture. Unfortunately, in shifting letters to optimize solely for overall colour, the algorithm would disfigure the <em>gestalten</em> of individual words, at times even rendering them <nobr>illegible.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-30" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-30" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">In the theoretical limit, a perfectly uniform texture determined by a fixed number of such correlations would need to be perfectly periodical, thereby constraining our test image, at best, to a set of repeating letters.</span> Fortunately, the texture of well-fitted text is typically (but not necessarily) <em>pretty</em> even across the page, but it does not make for a good optimization target.</p>
<p>When V2 neurons detect texture-like correlations between neighbouring V1 neurons, they tend to return inhibitive feedback signals, especially to the V1 neurons in the center. This kind of “surround suppression”, which acts in addition to the lateral inhibition between V1 cells discussed above, helps mute V1 activity inside similarly-textured <nobr>areas.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-31" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-31" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">One way to explore potential neural architectures to accomplish this is via computational modelling; see e.g. experiments like <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnn.4128">this one</a> by Ruben Coen-Cagli et al.</span> Because this mechanism <em>leasts</em> affects the boundaries between differently-textured surfaces, it allows us to perceive the outlines of textured objects even when those are weaker (in terms of raw V1 responses) than the textures themselves: think of a Zebra on the savanna, or of a cluster of regular strokes on a white background—perhaps a word on a page!</p>
<p><img src="img/surround_suppression.png" alt="surround suppression example" /></p>
<p>This surround suppression therefore is a kind of early perceptual grouping mechanism, enabled by correlation-detecting V2 <nobr>neurons.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-32" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-32" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Another way to think of this, from the perspective of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_coding">predictive coding</a>, is as compression of redundant signals, as Laurence Aitchison and Máté Lengyel <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.conb.2017.08.010">have pointed out</a>.</span> The strength of the segmentation certainly depends greatly on the scale, pattern, and contrast of the objects involved, so it is difficult to say to what degree it affects the perception of words. But inhibitive (as well as facilitatory) feedback is likely present between higher-level brain areas as well, and the corresponding dynamics are implicated in other grouping-related phenomena as well, such as <em>crowding</em>, which we will address later.</p>
<h2 id="contour-integration-and-v1-feedback">Contour integration and V1 feedback</h2>
<p>Not all V2 neurons respond to such peculiar V1 correlations, expressing elements of texture. Some pick up on signals with more human-interpretable salience, such as continuous edges and lines. Experiments suggest that they do so by responding to V1 complex cells that co-align:</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-33" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-33" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">Each cell corresponds to a V1 complex cell tuned to a certain orientation (the distribution in frequency scales is ignored here). Note that the number of V1 cells is exaggerated for effect. This neuron responds to collinear V1 activations suggesting the presence of a horizontal contour, even if curved (see the gray stroke in the sample shown). It may be inhibited by parallel flanking contours and perpendicular contours, although this is less clear. This pattern has been called “association field”, “bipole”, and many other names in papers going back to the 1990s.</span> <img src="img/v2_contour_integration.png"

Of course, the same principle applies to texture integration across space.</p>
<p>Having thus detected a piece of contour, the V2 neuron now sends an amplifying signal to all of its V1 inputs, which in turn increases the input to the V2 cell itself, creating a positive feedback loop between V1 and V2. Crucially, however, this feedback only amplifies neurons that are already firing; it does not induce activity in other inputs (and may even suppress <nobr>them).<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-36" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-36" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Physiologically, this kind of modulatory amplification may be related to increased spike synchrony between neurons, as explored in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.01142.2015">this 2016 study</a> by Wagatsuma et al.</span> <nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-37" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-37" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote"><img src="img/contour_integration_example.png" alt="Contour

<p><img src="img/v2_contour_integration_2.png"></p>
<p>This kind of feedback loop is a simple grouping mechanism of its own, and responsible for many (though not all) observations of <em>prägnanz</em> due to collinearity. As we will see below, however, it is also an important ingredient in letter and word perception.</p>
<h2 id="v4-and-higher-level-areas">V4 and higher-level areas</h2>
<p>The next area of the visual cortex, area V4, mirrors the architecture of V2 in that it performs a set of convolutions detecting correlations between its inputs. It is reasonable to conceptualize V4 as V2, only with larger receptive fields. Its neurons respond, once again, to a large variety of spatial correlations in the input image, although these correlations can be more complex, looking perhaps more like this:</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-38" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-38" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">Again, these images are taken from <a href="https://doi.org/10.23915/distill.00024">Olah et al., 2020</a>.

<p>Once again, some neurons tend to be more tuned to textures while others detect straight or curved contour fragments, although there certainly is overlap between the two <nobr>categories.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-39" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-39" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">As in the case in V4, at least in macaques, as shown by studies like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3073-18.2019">this one</a> by Anitha Pasupathy and her collaborators.</span> Just as in V2, the contour detectors integrate smaller contour fragments across a larger region. However, the larger receptive fields of V4 allow for the target contours to be substantially offset from the center of the neuron’s receptive field. As such, a neuron centered <em>on</em> the target object can detect parts of its contour:</p>

<h2 id="perceptual-grouping-based-on-border-ownership">Perceptual grouping based on border ownership</h2>
<p>Consider that navigating our natural environment requires us to correctly identify three-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space. But the shape of these objects varies heavily depending on perspective—after all, we only see a two-dimensional projection of reality—and is available only as a collection of the abovementioned V4 contour fragments. What’s more, the contour detectors will activate on <em>both sides</em> of each object:</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-41" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-41" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">Two V4 contour detectors, tuned to the same eccentricity, angle, and curvature, activate in response to a dark blob shape.

<p>How can we recognize a half-overlapped object, discount its perspective foreshortening and assign it a relative depth, going only by a population of V4 contour detectors, half of which are gratuitously detecting the objects’ outsides? The solution lies in feedback loops that enable perceptual grouping.</p>
<!--
two categories of neurons are particularly noteworthy: texture
detectors and contour detectors.{sn}Our understanding of V4 is primarily owed to
Anitha Pasupathy and her collaborators, who have been publishing
results like [this one](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.2001.86.5.2505),
[this one](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.01265.2006), [this

one](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02438-8) for nearly two
decades.{/sn} Just as in V2, the contour detectors integrate smaller contour
fragments across some region. However, the larger receptive fields of V4 allow
for the target contours to be substantially offset from the neuron's receptive
field center:
-->
<p>The first feedback loop connects V4 with a special class of V2 neurons called <em>border ownership cells</em> or B-cells. These B-cells, like the V2 contour-integrating cells already discussed, detect the presence of edges based on the activity of V1 complex cells. While they are agnostic to the edge’s contrast polarity, B-cells fire only if they are on one particular side of an object. For instance, the B-cell whose receptive field is marked in red below only detects edges on the <em>left side</em> of objects, as indicated here by the small protrusion pointing toward the <nobr>right.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-42" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-42" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Almost everything we know about border ownership networks is owed to Johns Hopkins researcher Rüdiger von der Heydt and his students.</span></p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-43" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-43" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">Here, the B-cell responds to stimuli 1 and 2, but not 3 and 4.</span> <img src="img/b_cell_1.png" alt="B cell illustration"></p>
<p>This is remarkable. After all, the B-cell only sees a single edge. It cannot know which part of the object it is on; its receptive field is much too small. So its activity must be gated by a neuron which does: namely, one of our higher-level V4 <nobr>neurons.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-44" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-44" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Lateral inhibition from other V2 neurons cannot explain this behaviour, because horizontal connections conduct <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1152%2Fjn.00928.2010">too slowly</a> to explain the lab-measured response times of B-cells.</span> The object owning the edge fragment could have any shape and size, so <em>all</em> active V4 neurons whose contour templates coincide with the edge fragment send amplifying signals to our B-cell. In turn, our B-cell directly contributes to their activation, establishing a positive feedback loop:</p>
<p><img src="img/bg_feedback_0.png" alt="B-cell feedback loop"></p>
<p>There is an entire population of B-cells, distributed across V2’s retinotopy. For instance, consider a right-side B-cell (blue below) neighbouring our left-side B-cell. Both B-cells are engaged in feedback loops with V4 neurons while simultaneously inhibiting local competitors—i.e., each other—in proportion to their own activation strength (recall our discussion of lateral inhibition in V1):</p>
<p><img src="img/bg_feedback_1.png" alt="B-cell feedback loop"></p>
<p>If the interior (red) V4 cells now were to fire more strongly than the exterior (blue) ones, then the inward-pointing (red) B-cells would quickly inhibit the outward-pointing (blue) ones, firmly establishing that the border belongs to an object on the right. What would cause the interior (red) V4 cells to dominate?</p>
<p>Research suggests that higher-level cells, perhaps in the posterior inferotemporal cortex, respond to combinations of V4 contour-detecting neurons centered on the same retinal location. Such cells effectively group together the borders owned by an object, and are therefore called G-cells.</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-45" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-45" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">Here, the G-cell is shown as a blurred circle around a center. The blurred circle corresponds to the location of contours that this G-cell responds to.</span> <img src="img/bg_feedback_2.png" alt="B-cell feedback loop"></p>
<p>Consider the following situation, and make a guess whether at the circled location, left-side or right-side B-cells would win out:</p>
<p><img src="img/gestalt_1.png" alt="Gestalt B-cell 1"></p>
<p>Although <em>technically</em> the dark shape is a closed, contiguous shape and therefore on par with the light circle, it is intuitively obvious that the circle dominates, and even appears to lie above the black shape. As a result, we can confidently predict that humans will perceive the circled region as the left side of the circle, and not as the right side of the dark area. Why is that so?</p>
<p>As it turns out, the vast majority (although not all) of the object-centered contour detectors in V4 are either straight or convex in shape, with various degrees of curvature. This has the profound consequence that convex shapes tend to outcompete concave shapes in our perception.</p>
<p>In addition, overlapping objects create T-shaped junctions where their contours meet, as at the top and bottom of the light circle above. In such situations, lateral inhibition between V4 neurons tends to enhance the upper object’s continuous contour, while suppressing the percept of the acute angle formed inside the overlapped contour. This interaction helps strengthen the impression that the light circle lies in the <nobr>foreground.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-46" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-46" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">See <a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4766-10.2011">here</a> for a painstaking study of these effects by Brittany Bushnell et al. from the Pasupathy lab.</span></p>
<p>Meanwhile, although the hypothetical square detector served us well in the examples above, we actually do not know the population of shape detectors in our inferotemporal cortex. In simulations of perceptual grouping, it is therefore practical not to think directly about V4 contours and shape detectors. Instead, a popular approach is to work with a population of representative (if possibly fictitious) “grouping cells” or G-cells, each of which receives input from, and in turn feeds back to, a fuzzy annulus of inward-directed <nobr>B-cells:<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-47" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-47" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The first to run a simulation of this idea in earnest were <a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00203.2007">Edward Craft et al.</a> in 2011.</span></p>
<p><img src="img/bg_rfs.png" alt="Receptive fields of G cells"></p>
<p>Given that the V4 contour detectors chiefly pick up convex curvatures at some eccentricity, and circles are as convex as it gets, an this is really quite a reasonable model for whatever may truly be going on in our posterior inferotemporal areas.</p>
<p>To return the square example, consider first a population of coarse-scale G-cells, each of which is connected to B-cells that make up a circle about the size of our square. Among such coarse-scale G-cells, only the one centered on the square would respond noticeably, as it receives input from B-cells on all four sides (red below):</p>
<p><img src="img/g_responses.png" alt="Sample responses of some G cells"></p>
<p>Finer-scale G-cells would barely respond in most places. They would receive a bit of input near the square’s edges, but due to their nonlinear activation profile would only really light up inside the corners, where they receive inputs from B-cells on two sides (purple, blue). In addition, we may assume that G-cells compete via local inhibition, such that those cells receiving inputs from more (and from nearer) B-cells dominate.</p>
<p>Once B-cells and G-cells have settled into an equilibrium, the locus of peak responses of G-cells across different scales neatly represents the skeleton of the shape, shown on the <nobr>right:<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-48" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-48" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The technical term for this feat is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_axis">medial axis transform</a>.</span></p>
<p><img src="img/g_responses_skeleton.png" alt="Sample responses of some G cells,

<p>Skeletonization is critical to object recognition, because it allows us to match on a shape’s underlying geometric structure, instead of its exact <nobr>contours.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-49" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-49" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">And indeed, IT neurons appear to respond to skeleton fragments, such that a small population of IT neurons suffices to uniquely identify 3D shapes, as Chia-Chun Hung and colleagues <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.04.029">demonstrated</a> in Macaque monkeys.</span> Consider, for instance, our ability to recognize the following four styles of uppercase <em>E</em> with the same ease:</p>
<p><nobr><input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-50" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-50" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote">Many different uppercase-E designs exist, but all of them share a relationship between the relative locations of large-scale G-cell peaks (within the counters) and smaller-scale peaks (at the terminals).</span> <img src="img/e_skeletons.png" alt="Some skeletons at different scales"></p>
<p>Although the shared features of the skeletons (counters, stems, etc.) appear at different scales for different letter shapes, they are present in the same configuration for all of them.</p>
<p>This is true even for letters that are outlined (last row), as V4 contour detector neurons respond primarily to the contour, not to the fill (or its absence). Still we can ask: when is a stroke perceived as a contour, and when does it turn into a shape of its own right, a shape that owns contours on either side? With letter weights ranging from hairline to ultra-heavy, this is a particularly salient question:</p>
<p><img src="img/letter_weights.png" alt="A range of letter weights"></p>

<!--
A powerful arbiter of perceptual grouping, and key ingredient of
reading, is *attention*. In a network ruled by feedback loops and
lateral inhibition, attention is simply a bit of extra activity that
quickly propagates upwards and downwards, strengthening the perception
of a particular image feature while muting its surroundings.

[image]

In everyday parlance, "paying attention" implies looking straight at
an object of interest, and intentionally{sn}By which I merely mean
"triggered by frontal-lobe areas", without endorsing any Cartesian notions of
dualism.{/sn} activating corresponding populations of neurons.
But the more general, mechanistic understanding of attention—simply,
as the amplification of activity in some parts of the network at the
expense of others—includes paying attention to something in the corner
of one's eye ("covert attention") and even attention that is involuntarily
triggered by particular image features ("exogenous attention").

In practice, attention relies on the bidirectionality of the
feedback loops that connect shape detectors to V1 cells: the
appropriate visual input excites the shape detector, but attending
to (i.e., exciting) the shape detector also amplifies any active
V1 cells that are connected to it. This allows us to "select" a
feature corresponding to hundreds of V1 neurons by stimulating just
a single high-level cell.{sn}For a simulation of how this might
play out between G-cells and V1, take a look at Stefan Mihalaş et
al.'s [2011 paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1014655108).{/sn}
The selected V1 and V2 neurons, of course, have connections to
many brain regions besides V4, and all of them are indirectly
affected by the initial attention.{sn}This had led cognitive
scientists to call the early visual cortex a ["cognitive
blackboard"](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-vision-111815-114443).{/sn}

- When reading, we can focus our gaze on one word and pay covert attention to
  other words.


- 1. Different pieces of the image excite one another, thanks to feedback.
- 2. Different pieces of the image also suppress one another, so that only a few things are active at once. In particular, texturally similar areas suppress their inputs.
- 3. When something stands out from surrounding texture, it is therefore less suppressed, and automatically becomes the strongest neural population.
     We might call this a salient feature, or a feature that exogenously commands attention.
- 4. When we read, we need to perceive words as single units. The letter and word detector units in the visual word form area want to limit their input to one word at a time.
- 5. The challenge is to inject attention in the network at about PIT or V4, and
     have the activity spread sideways such that one word is selected, but have
     the suppression work its magic such that not everything gets selected. The
     brain is great at control theory and does that fine, but the job of a typographer is to make this as quick of a job as possible.

Particularly well-researched is a phenomenon called *crowding*, in which
activity spreads quickly and widely thanks to V2 and V4 cells responsive
to texture-like correlations over large spatial distances. These cells,
with their large receptive fields, are found particularly in the visual
periphery, where the crowding effect is particularly strong. When
crowding is strong, it is nearly impossible to attend to a location,
as any activity is immediately absorbed by the neural populations
representing texture, at the expense of local shape detectors. In the
following illustration, it is very difficult to make out the uppercase V
while focusing on the center cross, even though recognizing the left A, which
is exactly the same distance away, is no problem:

<img src="img/crowding_example.png" alt="Example of crowding between letters">

Text, of course, is inexorably texture-like,{sn}[And not by
accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_vocabulary); both
*text* and *texture* derive from Proto-Indo-European <em>\*teks–</em>,
meaning "to weave".{/sn} so the excitation of texture detectors and any
concomitant crowding are a fact of life. At first blush, crowded text is
illegible text, and thus to be prevented if possible. The research literature
offers suggestions: colouring the flanking letters, for instance, or putting
lots of space between them.{mn}As a rule of thumb, the spacing needs to be at least half the eccentricity, i.e. to the distance from the fovea (see
Herman Bouma's 1970 report ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1038/226177a0))). This is
roughly in line with the growth of receptive field diameters. But
careful: despite large distances, any extended regularity in spacing will
still trigger crowding, as Toni Sareela et al. [demonstrated in 2010](https://doi.org/10.1167/10.10.17).{/mn}

Instead I would like to suggest that peripheral crowding may actually
work in our favour, as it limits the volume of letter-like signals
impinging on our reading circuitry, thereby reducing the rate of misreadings.
While 

But crowding even happens in the fovea, depending on the shapes surrounding the
target. The effect is much smaller, but still measurable. For instance, when
given the task below, subjects make fewer mistakes on the left image:

[image]

- These kinds of experiments have made clear that crowding and grouping are really the
  same effect, and that they interact. For example, LAMINART study.

- Ultimately, it's not something we need to directly worry about when letterfitting,
  because we are dealing with pairs of letters at once, and we can assume that
  our algorithm (like a human designer) will fit them in the fovea, without much
  meddling from texture-detecting neurons.

- The dynamics happen so fast, and timing matters, especially when reading fast. Looking at a word or pair is a very different
  activity from reading (learning as a child) or reading (as an adult), and that
  has to be taken into account.

<!--
So far, we have described some important neural dynamics of the visual cortex,
between V1 and the early inferotemporal cortex. Experimental results have
yielded rich hypotheses about the neural architecture of perceptual grouping,
hypotheses that appear to explain many aspects of letterfitting practice.

But the patterns of neural activity involved in reading don't stop at the edge
of the visual cortex: about a quarter second after we first see a word, neurons
in the so-called *visual word form area* (VWFA) in our left fusiform gyrus (see
the anatomical illustration above) have settled the identity of the word.

The above sketch of the influence of attention 

Poor letterfitting can affect the performance of the VWFA beyond 

The visual word form area contains neurons that identify letters
and words. Letterfitting can affect the performance of these 

Understanding how this detection works may help us augment our
model to  aware of semantic issues that can affect design
decisions. One common issue is confusability (e.g. between *rn*
and *m*), but we can look beyond alphabetic letterfitting to the
relative placement of accents, and even to the strokes and components
of Hangul and Hanzi{sn}The recognition of Chinese
characters takes place in the *right* fusiform gyrus (the VWFA is in the left), a region
traditionally associated with face recognition (although [EEG
readings suggest that face-recognition circuitry isn't directly
involved](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0041103)). The
compositional mechanisms described here likely transfer in principle,
however.{/sn}—all of these are instances of the problem
of competitive perceptual grouping.

<p>Unfortunately, the dynamism of the scientific model(s) introduced thus far makes them unsuitable for use in practical letterfitting tools for type designers. Although it is relatively straightforward to set up systems of coupled differential equations representing individual neurons, integrating them at a sufficiently fine spatial resolution is immensely costly, and doing so over many iterations for each letter combination is outright infeasible, at least with consumer-grade hardware. We must therefore consider potential approximations to the model.</p>
<p class="missing">
Brief nod to existing solutions in the appendix, and how they happen to approximate (or not) some of the model characteristics discussed.
</p>
<p>As explained above, V1 simple cells are typically modelled as responding linearly via a simple Fourier-domain multiplication with a bank of bandpass filters <span class="math inline">G(s, o)</span>, where <span class="math inline">s</span> is the frequency scale and <span class="math inline">o</span> the <nobr>orientation.<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-53" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-53" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_filter">Gabor patches</a> are most commonly used, but many alternative models with better mathematical properties are available.</span> This set of convolutions turns the two-dimensional input image (width × height) into a four-dimensional tensor of complex numbers (width × height × spatial frequency scales × orientations), the magnitude and phase angle of which capture the activation of simple cells <span class="math inline">S_\mathrm{V1}</span> at every location:</p>

<p>where <span class="math inline">\mathcal{F}</span> is the Fourier transform. For instance, to retrieve wthe activation of representative simple cells at phases 0°, 90°, w180° and 270°, one ould half-wave-rectify as follows:</p>

S_{\mathrm{V1, 270\degree}}(x, y, s, o) &amp;= |-\mathrm{Im}(S_1(x, y, s, o)| \\
\end{aligned}
</span></p>
<p>Traditionally, complex cells were thought to sum the outputs of nearby simple cells of equal scale and orientation. This is now known to be a gross oversimplification. In software, a summation-like approach is nevertheless taken to approximate the output of complex cells <span class="math inline">C_{\mathrm{V1}}</span>, namely a simple computation of the absolute magnitude of the complex tensor:</p>
<p><span class="math display">
C_\mathrm{V1}(x, y, s, o) = |S_\mathrm{V1}(x, y, s, o)|^2
</span></p>
<p>This is often called the <em>local energy</em>. The squaring operation shown here is often used in the literature to approximate the nonlinear behaviour of complex cells in <nobr>particular.<input type="checkbox" id="mn-marginnote-55" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="mn-marginnote-55" class="margin-toggle"></label><span class="marginnote"><img src="img/hra.png"

<p>The <span class="math inline">f</span> scales the curve vertically, <span class="math inline">k</span> makes the kink steeper, and <span class="math inline">\beta</span> shifts the threshold to the right.

<p>This formula is particularly relevant thanks to <em>lateral inhibition</em>, a common architectural pattern in the brain in which neurons within a cortical area suppress their neighbours in proportion to their own firing rate. Locally, this allows the most active neuron to suppress its neighbours more than those neighbours are able to suppress it in return. Lateral inhibition thus sharpens peaks and flattens valleys in the activity landscape; it is a simple and effective way to boost salient signals relative to the weaker ones that inevitably arise from the correlations between similarly tuned convolution filters. In V1, lateral inhibition thus sharpens the orientation and frequency-scale signals, while also normalizing local contrast.</p>
<p>Because lateral inhibition is a recurrent process that takes time to reach a steady state, it is most accurately modelled using a system of coupled differential equations which describe the time dependence of each neuron’s firing rate on its neighbours. Conveniently, however, the steady-state activations can also be approximated directly using our hyperbolic ratio model, by simply sneaking the neighbouring neurons’ activities into the <nobr>denominator:<input type="checkbox" id="sn-sidenote-57" class="margin-toggle"></nobr><label for="sn-sidenote-57" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">See <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08246.pdf">this analysis</a> by Jesús Malo et al. to understand how this approximation works.</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">y_i = \frac{fx_i^k}{\beta^k + \sum_j w_j x_j^k}</span></p>
<p>This approximation is called <em>divisive normalization</em>. One can find many variations on the above formula in the literature: extra constants, extra square roots in the denominator, extra rectifiers, etc.; but the core idea is always the same.</p>
<p>This raises the challenge of determining the right values for <span class="math inline">w_j</span>, i.e. modelling the inhibitive strengths of neighbourly connections.

What’s more, the last decade of research has revealed that some measured behaviours previously ascribed to lateral inhibition may instead be the result of feedback from higher-level areas. If nothing else, <span class="math inline">w_j</span> is probably a convenient place for modellers to incorporate the effects of spatial frequency dependency (i.e. contrast sensitivity curves).</p>

Appendix: Existing letterfitting tools
</h2>
<p>Most existing approaches operate either on the distance between stems, or on the area of the gap between them. Some are hybrids, more complex, or unpublished; finally, there has been some experimental work using neural nets:</p>
<p><img src="img/heuristics_classification.png"
alt="Heuristics" /></p>
<p><strong>Fixed-distance methods:</strong> A family of approaches that insert pre-defined distances between letter pairs. In their simplest incarnation, these heuristics are equivalent to simply adding sidebearings to every letter, without any kerns. <a href="https://github.com/hodefoting/kernagic">Kernagic</a>, inspired by <a href="https://www.lettermodel.org/">Frank Blokland’s research</a>, uses heuristics to identify stems or stem-equivalents (such as the round sides of an o) in every letter shape, and then aligns them. This works reasonably well with very regular type (think blackletter), but manual adjustments are usually required. Less well known is Barry Schwartz’ <a href="https://github.com/chemoelectric/sortsmill/blob/master/tools/spacing_by_anchors.py">anchor point implementation</a> of what amounts to basically the same idea. Adrian Frutiger, Walter Tracy and Miguel Sousa have devised similar systems, described in Fernando Mello’s <a href="http://www.fermello.org/FernandoMello_essay.pdf">MATD thesis</a>. The legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hz-program">Hz-Program</a> is also included in this category, as its <a href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?FT=D&amp;date=19941019&amp;DB=&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;CC=EP&amp;NR=0466953B1&amp;KC=B1&amp;ND=1#">patent application</a> reveals that letter pair distances were simply stored in a hardcoded table.</p>
<p><strong>Gap area quadrature:</strong> A family of algorithms that attempt to quantify and equalize the perceived area of the inter-letter gap. The crux, of course, lies in deciding where the gap ends. <a href="https://huertatipografica.github.io/HTLetterspacer/">HT Letterspacer</a>, the crudest one of these tools, considers everything between baseline and x-height (modulo some minor refinements). Simon Cozens’ <a href="https://github.com/simoncozens/CounterSpace">CounterSpace</a> uses blurs and convex hulls to more effectively exclude regions that arguably don’t belong to the gap (such as the counter of c). My own <a href="https://www.aldusleaf.org/2019-03-17-letterfitting-attention-model.html">Electric Bubble</a> model measures Euclidean instead of horizontal distances, but imposes geometric constraints that produce similar results to CounterSpace. CounterSpace currently wins in terms of performance-complexity ratio but it, too, struggles to fit certain letter pairs.</p>
<p><strong>Other shape-based methods:</strong> These include more exotic approaches, such as stonecarver <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kindersley">David Kindersley</a>’s “wedge method” from the 1960s, which operated on letter area moments of inertia (and didn’t really work), and <a href="https://ikern.com/k1/">iKern</a>, which produces great results but, just like Adobe’s <a href="https://typedrawers.com/discussion/3006/how-does-adobes-automatic-optical-kerning-work">Optical Kerning</a> feature, remains unpublished. Last but not least, the <a href="http://charlesmchen.github.io/typefacet/topics/autokern/typefacet-autokern-manual.html">TypeFacet Autokern</a> tool identifies parts of letter outlines that jut out horizontally, and adds kerning to compensate, based on a few parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Neural nets:</strong> Yes, we can train convolutional nets to recognize images of well-fitted and poorly-fitted type. Simon Cozens has built several versions of his <a href="https://github.com/simoncozens/atokern">kerncritic</a> model (formerly AtoKern), and the recent ones perform surprisingly well on many (if not all) pairs. While neural nets are fascinating, they tend to be black boxes: we can only make guesses at how they work, and we cannot tune their behaviour to suit our taste. This problem holds not just for convolutional nets, but for statistical function approximators in general; I do not discuss them further here.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/comp.fonts/laurence$20penney$20kern/comp.fonts/GEjTE9_H52M/BSLdSE2lgmsJ">Bubble Kerning</a> is a proposal that type designers draw a bubble around every letter, such that software can automatically find pair distances by simply abutting the bubbles. While this isn’t technically a letterfitting heuristic at all, it’s still worth mentioning as a neat idea that could perhaps save designers some time. Toshi Omagari has built a <a href="https://github.com/Tosche/BubbleKern">Glyphs plugin</a>.</p>
